"""
The sums traveling from top to bottom will be the same as the sums traveling from 
bottom to top. Start at the second to bottom row, and for each number  in that
row, do the following: Take the maximum of the numbers directly down and left or
down and right from , and add that to . Now do the same for the third-to-last row,
then fourth-to-last, and so on. Weâ€™re modifying the triangle as we go to produce
maximum partial sums from the bottom, and the last stage will be to replace to top
number in the triangle, which will then be the maximum sum.
